   <p>In my 3D scanning park project, I employed particleization techniques to bring the flowers to life. Through meticulous 3D scanning, I captured the essence of these flowers, ensuring their intricate details were faithfully represented in digital form. Utilizing TouchDesigner, I then applied mesmerizing particle effects inspired by musical visualizations to imbue the flowers with dynamic energy.</p>

      <p>The result was a captivating fusion of art and technology, as the flowers' digital counterparts danced gracefully across different spaces within the room. Each particle effect was meticulously choreographed to interact harmoniously with the accompanying music, creating a multisensory experience that engaged both sight and sound.Throughout this assignment, I delved deep into the realms of 3D scanning techniques and TouchDesigner particle effects, honing my skills in digital artistry and audiovisual integration. This journey not only expanded my technical knowledge but also deepened my appreciation for the boundless creativity that emerges at the intersection of technology and art.</p>
      <p>Picture 1 shows the particleized video output by Touch designer. I first drag the 3D scan file into Touch designer, use the component pointtransform to build the point cloud particleization of the scan file, use the thresh component to build different color thresholds to increase the softness of the particle diffusion, add the feedback component to make the particles have a shadow effect, and finally add the rendering three-piece suite: render component / geometry/camera.</p>
      <p>Next, I select the point cloud system through pointselect, connect to math to change the range of values, connect to text3D to build the point cloud texture and color, and finally drag in the geometry's instancing color OP and select RGB respectively. the color of the point cloud is set up!</p>
      <p>Picture 2 illustrates my specialization in learning how TouchDesigner facilitates the interaction between music and images. In Figure 3, I have documented my notes in Chinese, outlining the process as follows: Firstly, I utilize the 'audiofilein' to import the created music file into TouchDesigner. Next, I analyze various music parameters using 'audioAnalysis,' such as high-level and low-level features. I then select a specific channel and adjust its value range using the 'math' component. Additionally, I utilize the 'speed' component to control the frequency of sound changes, which subsequently informs visual alterations based on this frequency. To activate the component, I connect it to the 'null' component and adjust the parameters within the parent set.</p>
      <p>Through the exploration of TouchDesigner's Kantan Mapper, I have embarked on a journey of creativity and innovation, as showcased in the series of five videos I present. Each video encapsulates my endeavor to design interactive spaces in diverse environments.</p>
      <p>In the first video, I unveil the projection of three distinct spaces nestled within a corner, demonstrating the versatility of TouchDesigner's capabilities. The second video unveils a spontaneous projection onto a paper sculpture by Tim Tutor, a personal favorite rendition that encapsulates my creative spirit.The third video delves into the intriguing concept of projecting onto a pipe, showcasing the seamless adaptation of the projection's shape to the pipe's unique characteristics.In the fourth video, I refine my TouchDesigner file, imbuing the imagery with dynamic movement synchronized to the rhythm of the music, while also undergoing a metamorphosis in color, transitioning from its original real-world shade to a vibrant digital hue.The fifth video introduces an innovative blinking effect, where the flower pulsates in sync with the music's tempo, while bold color experiments push the boundaries of creative expression.</p>
      <p>Overall, this assignment has been a transformative experience, enriching my understanding of 3D scanning, particle effects, musical interaction, and projector utilization. It has fueled my passion for creative exploration and affirmed my commitment to pushing the boundaries of digital artistry.</p>
